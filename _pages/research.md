My research focuses on radio transients, specifically Fast Radio Bursts. I have been lucky enough to be part of the CRAFT project which uses ASKAP to search for Fast Radio Bursts. Our team has made various achievements and discoveries, including the first real-time localisation of a single FRB event.

## FRB Software testing
At the start of my PhD I conducted a series of FRB injection tests to assess the performance of the CRAFT FRB pipeline. 
The core software of the pipeline is the fast dedispersion trial code FREDDA, an implementation of the FDMT algorithm written in CUDA.
You can check out my thesis for a brief summary of some of the performances by FREDDA.
## X-ray transients in the 3XMM Catalogue
I am also interested in X-ray transients, I discovered one X-ray binary during my undergraduate thesis project in Nanjing. 
You can check out this Symbiotic X-ray Binary [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...847...44Q/abstract).
