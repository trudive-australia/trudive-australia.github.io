Hi I'm Harry, I'm a PhD student studying radio astronomy at the University of Sydney. My supervisor is Prof. Tara Murphy.

Fast Radio Bursts

The main research topic of my thesis is using the Australian SKA Pathfinder to detect and analyse Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). I am part of the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients (CRAFT) project, led by my co-supervisors Dr. Keith Bannister and Dr. Ryan Shannon.
